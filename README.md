# flower-identification-ml
A machine learning project for flower identification using logistic regression and feature extraction from CNN.

🌸 flower-identification-ml
A machine learning project for flower identification using logistic regression and feature extraction from CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks).

📌 Project Overview
This project aims to identify different types of flowers by combining the power of deep learning and classical machine learning. We use a pre-trained CNN model to extract deep features from flower images, which are then classified using a logistic regression model.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍

*TensorFlow / Keras

*Scikit-learn

*NumPy & Pandas

*Matplotlib & Seaborn

*OpenCV (optional for image preprocessing)

⚙️ Workflow
Data Collection
Flower image dataset with 5 classes.

Preprocessing

Resize and normalize images

Convert labels into categorical format

Feature Extraction

Use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., VGG16 or MobileNet)

Extract features from intermediate layers

Model Training

Train a logistic regression classifier using the extracted features

Evaluation

Accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

Visual inspection of correctly and incorrectly classified images
